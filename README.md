# Income_Data_Analysis
## Overview
EDA of the Adult Income dataset to identify the key factors that influence earning above $50K.

## DataSet
- The dataset includes features like **age**, **education**, **occupation**, **work hours per week**, **capital gain/loss**, **race**, **native country**, and more.  
- The variable **income** is binary (<=50K or >50K).
## What I did?
My task was to:
- Discover relationships between demographic/work factors and income levels.
- Build visualizations that communicate insights clearly.
In the Exploratory Data Analysis, I performed following steps
- Visualized age, education, hours-per-week, and capital gains distributions.
-Compared income across workclass, occupation, education level, gender, and race.
-Created a correlation heatmap for numerical features.
## Conclusions Drawn
- Higher degrees greatly increase the likelihood of earning >50K.
- Management, professional specialties, and technical roles pay significantly more.
- Men are more likely to earn above 50K than women, even with similar attributes.
- Middle-aged individuals (40–55) have the highest rates of >50K.
- Most of professionals work in private sector.
## Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy (data handling)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
